# Colton Allen's Weather Application

## This was my first React Project

This Weather Application is simple, true, but it was my first build as I began learning the React.js library, and I am still happy with it to this day. In addition to the api calls to fetch current weather in various locations throughout the world, I also implemented geolocation so that immediately when you open the app, after allowing access to the device's location of course, it will gather your gps location and fetch the current weather wherever you are.
